    "Akka `TestProbe()` is like a remote controlled actor. It's only purpose is to buffer incoming messages in internal queue so they can inspected in test procedure. When we write test, we cannot use `akka.Main` class we need to start the system. \n",

    "The `ActorSystem` comes with so called gaurdian actor. `system.actorOf` create a request to gaurdian actor to create this actor for us. We also need to shut it down. The `TestProbe` is an actor driven from outside.  We can also create `TestProbe` inside. We can run a test in the context of probe. We can do it by using `TesKit` class.\n",

    "## Testing Actors with Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Actor might have external dependencies. For example the actor need to talk to database, or web service. Traditional solution is to use dependecny injection. You can use Akka together with Spring. One simple solution is to add overridable factory methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at `Receptionist`. The Receptionist needs to create a controller in,\n",
    "under certain circumstances, and if we hard wire the props controller in the actor of call, we cannot stub it out in a test.\n",
    "What we can simply do is to add a\n",
    "method, `controllerProps`, which gives these props with the known behavior.\n",
    "And this allows us to override\n",
    "this method in a test to create a different actor which, for\n",
    "example, does not really go to the Web to retrieve the links.\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "\n",
    "class Receptionist extends Actor {\n",
    "def controllerProps: Props = Props[Controller]\n",
    "def receive = waiting\n",
    "val waiting: Receive = {\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    val controller = context.actorOf(controllerProps, \"controller\")\n",
    "// upon Get(url) start a traversal and become running\n",
    "}\n",
    "def running(queue: Vector[Job]): Receive = {\n",
    "// upon Get(url) apppend that to queue and keep running\n",
    "// upon Controller.Result(links) ship that to client\n",
    "// and run next job from queue (if any)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, talking about that, if we look at the Getter, the Getter used WebClient get URL,\n",
    "if we want to switch out the WebClient\n",
    "from the real one which I've renamed AsyncWebClient here.\n",
    "To a fake one, we can just insert this method as shown, and\n",
    "then the test can override it.\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "class Getter extends Actor{\n",
